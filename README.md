# node-typescript-boilerplate-v1

A starting point for node projects using typescript.

# Pre-reqs

To get started, the following things will be needed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Getting started

- Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

- Run the project

```bash
yarn run dev
```

Or if you'd like to debug the project, a debug task exists to launch everything and monitor for changes. To use it, in Visual Studio Code go to the debug tab and start the `Debug start` debug task.

# Special thanks

This boilerplate is based on a number of different sources.
